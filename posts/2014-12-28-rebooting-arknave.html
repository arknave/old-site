    <p>After a few weeks of downtime, I’ve moved my blog from arknave.com to arknave.me. The old domain name was a birthday/christmas present, but when it expired earlier this month, I saw no reason to renew it when Namecheap was offering free .me domain names for students.</p>
<p>While moving the site to the new domain, I also took the opportunity to change the underlying technology stack. While the old blog was an instance of <a href="https://ghost.org">Ghost</a>, the new blog is a simple static site generated by <a href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll">Hakyll</a>, a Haskell static site generator. Ghost is an awesome blogging platform, but I blog infrequently and don’t need the overhead of a dynamic site. By using Hakyll, I’m able to serve my site from <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> and save on the cost of a full server. Furthermore, the static site feels much faster to load and read than the old ghost blog.</p>
<p>Migrating the posts was fairly painless. Ghost saves all of the original markdown in the sqlite database, so I wrote a script to dump them into files. Dropping those files into Hakyll worked flawlessly.</p>
<p>I’m not afraid to get my hands dirty with some basic HTML and CSS, so I wrote a lot of the HTML by hand. The CSS is generated by <a href="http://fvisser.nl/clay/">Clay</a>, a CSS preprocessor written in Haskell. I don’t use many advanced features of Clay, but having variables for colors and sizes makes writing CSS much more tolerable.</p>
