<article class="post-content">
    <p>After a little over ten posts, I realize I’ve never introduced myself to the internet! Hi, I’m Arnav Sastry. I’m finishing up my senior year at LASA High School in Austin, TX. I like long walks on the beach, romantic candlelit dinners, and computer algorithm competitions like TopCoder and CodeForces.</p>
<p>Anywho, let’s look at colleges. At the beginning of the year, I had narrowed my list down to ten colleges, by the end of the semester, I had only applied to seven. Let’s go through the list, in order of acceptance.</p>
<h3 id="the-schools">The Schools</h3>
<h4 id="ut-dallas">UT Dallas</h4>
<p>This was my safety school. I was guaranteed admission because of my ACT score. It’s got a good computer science program - their graduate program is ranked in the top 50 CS programs (my thoughts on rankings in a future post). I also got the AES Honors scholarship, which covers tuition and gives a little extra money for scholarships. That said, I don’t think I’ll go to UTD - it’s not known for its CS program or academic rigor.</p>
<p>Odds (of enrollment): &lt; 1%</p>
<h4 id="ut-austin---turing-scholars">UT Austin - Turing Scholars</h4>
<p>I’m really unsure how I feel about this university. UTCS standard is a highly regarded computer science program, and Turing is the creme de la creme within that. It strikes the right balance of in-state affordability and prestigious computer science program, even if they aren’t known nationally like MIT, Stanford, or CMU.</p>
<p>The main reservation with UT is that it’s too close to home. I’d like to experience college in a different city and preferably in a different state. Despite the program’s small size, the university is still huge, and I’m worried about course flexibility. That said, UT’s is still my frontrunner.</p>
<p>Odds: ~50%</p>
<h4 id="georgia-institute-of-technology">Georgia Institute of Technology</h4>
<p>Georgia Tech strikes me as having a comparable level of prestige to UTCS, but maybe not quite as nice as the Turing Scholars program. It’s in Atlanta, which is not Austin, but the campus isn’t in a good neighborhood. It’s also considerably more expensive than UT Austin, so there’s a lower chance that I’ll attend.</p>
<p>Odds: ~20%</p>
<h4 id="washington-university-in-st.louis">Washington University in St. Louis</h4>
<p>I think I only applied to this school because I needed another mid-range option (my orignal list had too many reach schools), and it didn’t require any essays aside from the Common App. I’m really surprised I got in, many people told me that WUSTL only accepts applicants that express lots of interest / visit campus.</p>
<p>Of the schools I’m considering, it has the worst CS department, and the cost is high. That said, the quality of life at WUSTL is great: they’ve got Tempurpedic beds, amazing dorm food, and they’re not in Austin. However, all these luxuries come at a high price. I don’t think I’m going to go.</p>
<p>Odds: ~5%</p>
<h4 id="carnegie-mellon-university">Carnegie Mellon University</h4>
<p>Carnegie Mellon was my top choice among the schools I thought I had shot of getting into. They let freshman do research and the School of Computer Science (SCS) means business when it comes to theoretical computer science research. Unfortunately, I was waitlisted for SCS, but was admitted as a math major at the Mellon College of Science (MCS). According to the CMU Facebook group, math majors have some of the lowest requirements of any major, making double majoring or minoring in CS possible (I originally wanted to major in CS and minor in math). I’m going to visit, and keep an open mind.</p>
<p>Odds: ~25%</p>
